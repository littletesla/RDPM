## RDPM
We propose a robust and communication-efficient distributed method for estimating high-dimensional precision matrices in the presence of heavy-tailed or contaminated data, leveraging modified Cholesky decomposition and a shrinkage-based robust loss.

The uploaded code consists of two parts, one is the preliminary experiment to determine the hyperparameters, and the other is the formal simulation.
